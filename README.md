# NBA Games Simulator

This application will simulate NBA games for the purpose of predicting the outcomes of any game between two teams chooen by user. The games will be repeated by a number of times selected by user to approximate the chance of a particular team winning a match and the possibility of going to an overtime. 

This project have two components, a scraper and python application.

# Data Collection 
Teams data will be collected from stats.nba.com. This is a website by the NBA that have all the teams data and statistics for every game. Unfortunately the site doesn't have a public API, so I used the Requests library to access the data for the current NBA season. The data will be gathered and transformed into a DataFrame that will allow us to use it easily.
